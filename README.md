# MyPyGLM

(My attempt at making) a generalized learning model in Python. Will someday model neural activity of mosquitos flying in windtunnels, informed by parrallel research being done (electrophysiology of mosquitos presented with stimuli as well as behavioral data of mosquitos in a tethered flight arena).
